# wardxela's dotfiles

Shared configuration files for NixOS and MacOS.

## Philosophy

- Keyboard-first interaction
- One app on the screen at a time
- No docks and menu bars on the screen
- No distracting things like animations and wallpapers
- Prefer CLI over GUI
- Prefer defaults when possible

## Features

- Declarative configuration powered by [Nix](https://nixos.org/)
- Fully configured MacOS. Essential features include:
  - Tweaked Dock, Finder and other system preferences
  - Enabled [AeroSpace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace) window manager
  - `Caps Lock` key is bound for language switching without delay. Read my article
  ["Caps Lock sucks on MacOS"](https://telegra.ph/Test-02-22-369) for more details
- Installed and configured essential development tools

## Progress:

- [x] Add support for Linux
- [ ] Installation guide
- [ ] Custom nix options
- [ ] Docs: repo structure
